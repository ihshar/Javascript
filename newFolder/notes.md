# javascript and classes

## OOP
-Object Oriented Programming

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase()

## why use OOP
- because of Spaghetti Code
- it was very hard to maintain a big code base like when we wanted to take out something it was very difficult




## parts of OOP
Object literal -> {}

- Constructor function 
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

# this
- this refers to the current context 
- this in node js when console logged we get {}
- this in browser when console logged we get window object and prototypes

# 4 STEPS of new keywords 
- first {} A new empty object is created 
- then a constructor function is called because of new keyword and all the argument are packed and given to object 
- and then all the argument are injected in "this" keyword
- in last step it is given to us for the use in the function




## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
